## About
First we want to give a huge shoutout to [RumbleMike and his ValorantStreamOverlay project](https://github.com/RumbleMike/ValorantStreamOverlay), none of this would have possible without his work. Make sure to check it out if you haven't already. 

This program lets you visualize your (unofficial) ELO as you play competitive games. It keeps a history of your played games even after they are overwritten by your newer games. It supports up to 3 accounts so you can easily switch them.

Your username and password are used to make a call to the Riot API exlusively. We do not do anything with your account information. The code is open-source, if you want to compile the program into a jar yourself, you can. You do not have to save your account info, however, if you do then the program will save your username onto a textfile and the password will be encrypted in Base64.

The program also has auto updating capabilities, if your version is out of date it will prompt you to download the newest version. Dropbox is used to host the updates.
